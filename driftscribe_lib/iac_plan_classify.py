"""Classify a tofu ``plan.json``: does it CREATE a resource? (Phase C6).

Shared by the coordinator (``agent/main.py`` — to ROUTE create-class plans through the
merge-then-apply-from-main two-step flow) and the worker (``workers/tofu_apply`` — to
ENFORCE the ``iac/``-tree hash gate before admitting a create). It lives in
``driftscribe_lib`` because the coordinator image (``Dockerfile.agent``) copies
``driftscribe_lib/`` but NOT ``workers/``, and both consumers MUST agree on the
predicate. Pure; no I/O.

Fail-closed: any malformed/unexpected structure ⇒ ``True`` (route through the create
path's stricter gate, never the lenient C5 update path). On the WORKER this is strictly
safer — the create path additionally requires the sidecar hash gate, and
``resource_set_guard`` still refuses the malformed plan. On the COORDINATOR, the plan
view is already integrity-/parse-verified before classification, so a malformed plan
does not reach here in practice; the fail-closed default is a backstop.
